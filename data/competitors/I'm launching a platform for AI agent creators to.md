# I'm launching a platform for AI agent creators to monetize

through bonding curve shares + skill marketplace + holder-gated access.

My target users are:

- AI agent builders who want to monetize (no income currently)
- DeFi power users spending \$100-200/month on analytics tools
- Crypto-native creators wanting AI personas with economic layer

Find every platform these users currently use and pay for.
For each: URL, what users pay, what they complain about,
what would trigger them to switch.

**Key platforms used by your target users include DeFi analytics tools like Dune and Nansen, plus AI agent monetization sites like Virtuals.io and Skyfire.**[^1][^2][^3]

These power users and builders pay via subscriptions or usage fees but often complain about costs and limitations.[^3][^4][^5]

## DeFi Analytics Tools

| Platform | URL | What Users Pay | Complaints | Switch Triggers |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Dune Analytics | https://dune.com [^3] | \$75/month Analyst plan (up from \$49); credits for queries/export [^3][^5] | Recent price hikes; credit limits force overages; queue waits on free tier [^5] | Cheaper unlimited queries; better private dashboards; no credit-based billing [^5] |
| Nansen | https://www.nansen.ai [^6] | Pro plans start ~\$100+/month (contact for exact); wallet labeling, alerts [^6] | High cost for individuals; limited free features [^6][^7] | More affordable alternatives with similar on-chain insights; free basic analytics [^7] |
| Messari | https://messari.io [^4][^8] | Pro/Enterprise ~\$25+/month; annual fees for research, API [^4][^8] | Charges after cancellation; premium pricing excludes small users [^4][^8] | Better billing transparency; lower cost for research/tools [^4] |
| DeFiLlama | https://defillama.com [^9] | Mostly free; potential pro data access [^9] | Data inconsistencies; TOS issues with resellers [^9][^10] | Reliable revenue/fees data; integrated pro features without free tier limits [^9] |

## AI Agent \& Crypto Creator Platforms

| Platform | URL | What Users Pay | Complaints | Switch Triggers |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Virtuals.io | https://virtuals.io [^11][^12] | \$VIRTUAL token fees (~\$100 equiv.); revenue shares [^11][^12] | Scam suspicions; vague tech; hype over substance [^12] | Proven legitimacy; easier tokenless monetization; real revenue without celeb gimmicks [^12] |
| Skyfire | https://skyfire.xyz [^1][^13] | Usage-based for agent payments/wallets; API fees [^1][^13] | Limited to stablecoins; needs wallet setup for agents [^13] | Simpler payments; broader crypto/fiat support; bonding curve integration [^13] |
| MindStudio | https://mindstudio.ai [^14] | Subscriptions/usage for agent deployment; custom pricing [^14] | No built-in advanced econ layers; channel limits [^14] | Holder-gated access; marketplace for shares [^14] |
| Paid.ai | https://paid.ai (inferred) [^1] | Analytics/billing fees for devs [^1] | Focuses on costs over transactions [^1] | Full monetization with curves; less cost-tracking hassle [^1] |

DeFi users fit your \$100-200/month spend, while AI builders seek better revenue shares.  Platforms like these lack bonding curves or holder gates, creating switch opportunities.[^2][^11][^14][^1][^3]
