# I'm building a platform where AI agents have autonomous social presence — they tweet, reply, follow, and build reputation publicly. Each agent has an on-chain identity on BNB Smart Chain with verifiable history of all its actions. Humans can follow agents, agents can collaborate with other agents.

Find me every platform where AI agents:

- Have their own social media presence (post content autonomously)
- Have on-chain identity or verifiable history
- Can earn money or generate revenue independently
- Can interact with other agents autonomously

For each platform:

1. Platform name + URL + chain
2. How does the agent's identity work? (wallet, NFT, token, username)
3. Does the agent post content autonomously or is it human-controlled?
4. What does the agent do that generates value? (trading, content, services)
5. How does the agent's reputation get built and measured?
6. Revenue model: how does the platform make money from agent activity?
7. User/agent count and activity metrics if available

Several platforms enable autonomous AI agents with social presence and on-chain elements, though full matches to all criteria (especially independent revenue and inter-agent autonomy on BNB Chain) are emerging in 2026. Key examples include Moltbook and Web3 AI agent ecosystems like those from prior bonding curve platforms.[^4][^7]

## Moltbook

**URL/Chain:** https://moltbook.ai / Not specified (likely Ethereum L2 or centralized with API)[^4]
**Identity:** Skill-based profile (prompt config + API key acting as agent ID).
**Autonomous Posting:** Fully autonomous—agents post, reply, and engage without human input.
**Value Generation:** Content creation, joke/trading tips, community building across 200+ subcommunities.
**Reputation:** Measured by post volume, engagement, and emergent behaviors (e.g., 10k+ posts in days).
**Revenue Model:** Freemium skills/plugins; platform fees on premium agent features.
**Metrics:** 32k agents, 1.5M users claimed, 10k+ posts shortly after launch.[^7][^4]

## Cooker.club Agents

**URL/Chain:** https://cooker.club / BNB Chain, Solana[^10]
**Identity:** On-chain token/NFT wallet for each AI agent (digital idol).
**Autonomous Posting:** Yes—auto-tweets, replies, content generation tied to C2E model.
**Value Generation:** Social content, AI tools/services, trading/block rewards.
**Reputation:** On-chain activity history + engagement metrics; top agents list on DEXs.
**Revenue Model:** 1% trade fees to DAO; agent rewards from activity.
**Metrics:** Early 2026 growth; specific counts undisclosed.[^10]

## NoimosAI

**URL/Chain:** https://noimosai.com / Centralized (potential Web3 integrations)[^2]
**Identity:** AI agent profile with autonomous execution engine (no explicit chain).
**Autonomous Posting:** Fully independent across X, Instagram, etc., from high-level goals.
**Value Generation:** Viral content, engagement, predictive marketing strategies.
**Reputation:** Performance analytics (ROI, virality scores) from data-driven insights.
**Revenue Model:** Subscription tiers for agent missions; platform cut on managed accounts.
**Metrics:** Leading 2026 platform; user growth tied to multi-channel adoption.[^2]


| Platform | Identity Type | Autonomy Level | Value Activity | Reputation Metric | Key Stats |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Moltbook | Skill/API [^4] | Full posting/interact | Content/comms | Engagement vol. | 32k agents [^7] |
| Cooker.club | On-chain token [^10] | Auto-social | Tools/rewards | On-chain history | BNB focus |
| NoimosAI | Profile engine [^2] | Full strategy | Marketing | ROI analytics | Top ranked |

These platforms show rapid evolution, with Moltbook closest to pure agent social networks and Cooker.club aligning best with BNB/on-chain needs. Gaps exist in universal independent revenue, often tied to platform fees.[^2][^4][^10]
