# I'm building a platform where each AI agent has tradeable shares using a bonding curve mechanism. Share price increases automatically as more people buy. The agent creator earns a 5% fee on every trade perpetually. The platform also earns 5% on every trade. No external liquidity pool needed — the bonding curve IS the market.

Find me every platform — crypto/Web3 — that uses bonding curve mechanics to tokenize non-memecoin assets. Specifically platforms where:

- The underlying asset has some utility or productive output (not pure speculation)
- Creators earn ongoing revenue from trading activity
- There is some form of "quality signal" beyond just price

For each platform found:

1. Platform name + URL + chain
2. What is being tokenized (creator shares? agent tokens? content access?)
3. Exact fee structure: who pays what % to whom on each trade
4. How does the creator earn? Is it perpetual or one-time?
5. What determines the value of the token beyond speculation?
6. Trading volume and revenue numbers if available
7. What is the graduation/migration mechanism if any?
8. Is the creator incentivized to keep building after launch?

**Friend.tech matches your model closely for tokenizing creator social capital with utility.** Other Web3 platforms like Mint Club and Cooker.club enable customizable bonding curves for utility tokens, though many lean speculative.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

## Friend.tech

**URL/Chain:** https://friend.tech / Base (Ethereum L2)[^1]
**Tokenized:** Creator "keys" (social access shares).
**Fees:** 10% total on trades—5% to creator, 5% to platform.
**Creator Earnings:** Perpetual 5% on every trade.
**Value Beyond Spec:** Keys grant private chat access/utility; popularity signals demand.
**Volume/Revenue:** Peaked \$50M+ daily fees in 2023; declined post-2024.
**Graduation:** None—stays on bonding curve.
**Ongoing Incentives:** Yes, via perpetual fees; trading boosts visibility.[^2][^1]

## Mint Club

**URL/Chain:** https://mint.club / Ethereum, Polygon, Base[^5][^4]
**Tokenized:** Custom tokens/NFTs (any ERC20-backed, e.g., content access, tools).
**Fees:** Customizable royalties (creator sets % on mint/burn/trades).
**Creator Earnings:** Perpetual royalties on secondary activity.
**Value Beyond Spec:** User-defined utility (e.g., access, governance); customizable curves signal design quality.
**Volume/Revenue:** Not public; used for niche launches.
**Graduation:** Optional migration to DEXs.
**Ongoing Incentives:** Royalties encourage sustained promotion/utility adds.[^4]

## Cooker.club

**URL/Chain:** https://cooker.club / BNB Chain, Solana[^3]
**Tokenized:** AI Agent tokens (virtual idols, digital identities).
**Fees:** 1% on trades to platform DAO; 10% of block rewards to creator.
**Creator Earnings:** Perpetual from rewards + trades (post-launch).
**Value Beyond Spec:** AI features (auto-tweeting, tools); C2E rewards for productive agents.
**Volume/Revenue:** Early stage; tied to AI narrative growth.
**Graduation:** Auto-list to DEX (PancakeSwap/Raydium) at threshold.
**Ongoing Incentives:** Yes, via rewards for listed agents with activity.[^3]


| Platform | Asset Type | Trade Fee Split | Perpetual? | Utility Signal | Graduation |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Friend.tech | Creator keys | 5% creator, 5% plat. | Yes | Chat access | None [^2] |
| Mint Club | Custom tokens/NFTs | Custom royalty | Yes | User-defined | Optional DEX [^4] |
| Cooker.club | AI agents | 1% DAO + rewards | Yes | AI tools | DEX threshold [^3] |

Few pure non-memecoin examples exist beyond these; most bonding curves (e.g., Pump.fun) focus on speculation without strong utility/creator perpetuity. Emerging AI-Web3 hybrids like BNB Agents hint at growth but lack confirmed bonding curves.[^6][^7][^3]
