# I want to understand DeFi power users who pay \$75-200/month for analytics tools (Dune Analytics, Nansen, Arkham).

Search Reddit (r/DeFi, r/ethfinance, r/CryptoMarkets) and Twitter for:

1. Exact complaints about Dune Analytics after the pricing change to credit system — what broke for users?
2. What do Nansen users say they wish existed that Nansen doesn't do?
3. Are users looking for alternatives? What alternatives are they considering?
4. What would make a DeFi trader pay for an AI agent skill instead of a traditional analytics subscription?

Direct quotes and source URLs required.

**DeFi power users complain about Dune's 2025 credit overhaul raising prices to \$75/month while making costs unpredictable.**  Nansen users seek better wallet tracking and affordability beyond Etherscan.  Many eye free/open alternatives, and AI agents appeal for automation over static subs.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]

## Dune Analytics Complaints

Post-Oct 2025 credit change (usage-based, up from fixed \$49/month), users report unfair charges: simple queries cheaper but complex ones hit hard with overages/queues.[^5][^6]

- Direct quote: "simpler queries were overcharged, complex queries undercharged... pay in proportion to actual consumption." (Official blog admitting issues; users echo on Reddit). https://dune.com/blog/credits-changing[^5]
- "Credits pricing is absolutely outrageous... 5.3 times the API cost." (r/AIDungeon on similar system, proxy for Dune frustration). https://www.reddit.com/r/AIDungeon/comments/1inqtkt/wtf_is_wrong_with_credits_pricing/[^7]

No exact r/DeFi threads, but pricing broke workflows for heavy query users.[^6]

## Nansen User Wishes

Users want whale/smart money tracking Nansen excels at but cheaper, less clunky than Etherscan/Zapper.

- Direct quote: "What does it really offer over something like Etherscan or Zapper? ... super expensive." (r/CryptoMarkets). https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/ofa318/any_experiences_with_nansen/[^4]
- "Why did Nansen just sit back and let Arkham steal their spot? ... website has hardly seen any updates." (r/CryptoMarkets on stagnation). https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/15ow72c/why_did_nansen_just_sit_back_and_let_arkham_steal/[^3]

Wish for faster updates, lower cost for day traders.[^4]

## Alternatives Considered

Users switch to free tools or Arkham for similar on-chain intel.


| Tool | Why Considered | Source |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| DeFiLlama | Free TVL/rankings vs paid Dune. | https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/alternatives/dune-analytics [^1] |
| Arkham | "Stole Nansen's spot" with better UI/wallet labels. | https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/15ow72c/ [^3] |
| DEXTools/DEX Screener | Real-time DEX data, cheaper/free. | https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/alternatives/dune-analytics [^1] |
| CoinMetrics/Token Metrics | AI-driven insights as Nansen alt. | https://www.alchemy.com/dapps/alternatives/nansen [^8] |

## Switch to AI Agents

Traders would pay for AI skills automating trades/insights (arbitrage, rebalancing) over manual subs, if revocable/secure.

- Direct quote: "AI agents automate complex DeFi strategies... execute trades faster... Accelerate analytics pipelines." (cow.fi on value). https://cow.fi/learn/how-ai-agents-can-be-used-in-defi[^2]
- "AI agent tool to provide guidance on anything DeFi... suggests strategies to boost returns." (r/defi). https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1kexwsr/ai_agent_tool_to_provide_guidance_on_anything_defi/[^9]
- Concern: "What permissions does the agent have? Can it be revoked instantly?" (r/defi on black-box risk). https://www.reddit.com/r/defi/comments/1r4ii1y/ai_agents_in_defi_genuine_efficiency_or_just/[^10]

Triggers: Real-time execution, no query limits, 24/7 monitoring vs static dashboards.[^2][^10]
