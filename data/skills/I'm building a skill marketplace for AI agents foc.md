# I'm building a skill marketplace for AI agents focused on BSC (BNB Smart Chain)

users. BSC users are 80%+ retail traders, Asia-dominant, primarily DeFi-focused
(PancakeSwap, Venus, Alpaca). Many are active on Telegram, Twitter/X.

What are the top 10 most painful, time-consuming, or expensive problems that
BSC/crypto retail traders face daily that currently require:
(a) manual effort (checking websites, copy-pasting data), OR
(b) expensive paid subscriptions (\$20+/month), OR
(c) technical skills most retail users don't have

For each pain point:

1. Describe exactly what the user currently has to do manually
2. How much time does it cost per day/week?
3. What existing paid tool solves this? What does it cost?
4. How many users are paying for solutions? (any public data)
5. What subreddits, Telegram groups, or Twitter accounts are centered around this pain?

Focus on: on-chain analytics, wallet tracking, DeFi alerts, token research,
rug pull detection, yield farming, airdrop tracking, smart money signals.

Give me real pain points with evidence, not generic crypto problems.

BSC retail traders face intense daily friction from volatile DeFi, meme coins, and farming opportunities, often wasting 1-3 hours manually bridging data across apps. AI agents could automate 80%+ of these workflows profitably.[^10]
