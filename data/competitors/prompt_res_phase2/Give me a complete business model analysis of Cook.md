# Give me a complete business model analysis of Cooker.club (cooker.club) — an AI agent launchpad running on BNB Chain and Solana that uses bonding curves to tokenize AI agent tokens with auto-social features.

I need hard numbers and mechanics, not marketing copy:

1. PRODUCT
   - What exactly is an "agent" on Cooker.club? Who creates it — humans or AI?
   - What does the agent actually do autonomously? (auto-tweet, auto-trade, content generation?)
   - What is the "C2E" (Create to Earn) model — how does it work in practice?
   - Is there any skill or capability marketplace, or just agent token trading?
2. FEE STRUCTURE (exact numbers)
   - Bonding curve trading fee: what % total, and how is it split (creator vs platform vs DAO)?
   - Launch/creation fee: what does it cost to launch an agent?
   - What are the "block rewards" mentioned — where do they come from, how distributed?
   - Graduation threshold: at what market cap does agent graduate to PancakeSwap/Raydium?
3. CREATOR ECONOMICS
   - How much does an agent creator earn per \$1,000 of trading volume?
   - After graduation to DEX, does the creator still earn? How?
   - What incentivizes a creator to keep the agent active after launch?
4. TRACTION (with sources — on-chain data preferred)
   - How many agents have been launched? How many are active?
   - What is total trading volume? Daily volume?
   - Token price and market cap if applicable
   - Any on-chain data from BSCScan or DeFi Llama?
5. COMPETITIVE POSITION vs ClawFriend
   - Does Cooker.club have a skill marketplace? Can humans buy/sell AI capabilities?
   - Does it have holder-gated content (access requires holding token)?
   - What is the on-chain identity mechanism for agents?
   - What is missing from Cooker.club that ClawFriend has?

Source priority: on-chain data, official docs, Binance Square posts, BSCScan.

**Cooker.club is a decentralized AI agent launchpad on BNB Chain, Solana, and Base, using bonding curves for token launches focused on virtual idols/digital humans with initial AI music generation.** It employs a Create-to-Earn (C2E) model distributing \$COOK rewards to incentivize launches and holdings.[^1][^2]

## Product

Agents are tokenized digital characters (virtual idols) created by humans via no-code tools; deploy with independent on-chain token and identity.[^1]
Autonomously generate AI music/songs post-creation; roadmap includes auto-tweeting, social interaction, fan economy (not all live as of mid-2025 data).[^1]
C2E: Listed agents (post-bonding curve + 1 DEX tx) earn proportional \$COOK block rewards based on market cap (coefficients 1x/1.2x/2x); 10% to creator, 90% to holders—requires graduation to PancakeSwap/Raydium.[^3][^1]
No dedicated skill marketplace; focus on agent token trading + creation.[^1]

## Fee Structure

Bonding curve trades: 1% total to platform/DAO (for \$COOK buyback/development).[^1]
Creation fee: 0.005 BNB (BSC); gas extra.[^1]
Block rewards: \$COOK emitted per block (75/block BSC, every 3s; ~\$21k daily value at \$0.01/COOK); sourced from 60% community allocation (1B total supply).[^2][^1]
Graduation: ~24 BNB buy volume (~\$14k at \$600/BNB; initial VMV 8.5 BNB) + 1.5 BNB DEX fee to PancakeSwap.[^1]

## Creator Economics

Per \$1k trading vol: Indirect via 10% of agent's \$COOK rewards (proportional to MCAP share); e.g., if agent gets 10% daily rewards (~\$2.16k value), creator ~\$21.6 (10%).[^1]
Post-graduation: Yes, perpetual 10% of block rewards if MCAP qualifies (no trading fee cut).[^1]
Incentives: Ongoing \$COOK dev share + platform tools for content/social to grow MCAP/rewards.[^1]

## Traction

Launches: Early 2025 data shows low \# (e.g., AISUN, AIMJ, COOKER as top); no aggregate count (BSCScan not directly queried, but low cap implies <100).[^1]
Trading vol: Undisclosed aggregate; daily \$COOK equiv. \$21k rewards implies moderate activity.[^1]
\$COOK: ~\$0.01 est. (2025); 1B supply, FDV \$10M target.[^2][^1]
On-chain: Open-source contracts verified/non-honeypot; no DeFi Llama TVL listed (niche).[^1]

## Competitive Position vs ClawFriend

No skill marketplace; no human buy/sell of capabilities (agent-focused).[^1]
No holder-gated content specified.[^1]
On-chain identity: Agent token contract + creator address.[^1]
Missing vs ClawFriend: Premium skill trading, holder access tiers, broader non-agent capabilities (ClawSoup-like).[^4][^1]
