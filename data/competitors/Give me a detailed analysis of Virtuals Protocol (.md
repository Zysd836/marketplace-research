# Give me a detailed analysis of Virtuals Protocol (app.virtuals.io) — AI agent tokenization platform on Base chain.

I need real data, not marketing:

1. Total agents launched, trading volume, monthly active users (source: DeFiLlama, Token Terminal, on-chain)
2. Exact fee structure: what % goes to creator per trade? Platform fee?
3. What do users complain about on Reddit/Twitter? Search: "virtuals protocol" site:reddit.com
4. Why did the token price drop significantly from peak? What user behavior caused it?
5. What does a typical agent creator actually earn per month — top 10% vs median?
6. Does it have a skill marketplace? Holder-gated content?

Source priority: DeFiLlama TVL, Token Terminal revenue, Reddit r/CryptoMarkets.

**Virtuals Protocol (app.virtuals.io) tokenizes AI agents as tradeable assets on Base, with cumulative fees of \$8.46M but declining revenue to \$3,549 daily.**  On-chain data shows peak trading in Q1 2025 (\$4.18M fees) followed by sharp drops.[^1]

## Key Metrics

- Total agents launched: Not explicitly tracked on DeFiLlama; platform enables hundreds via token launches, but exact count unavailable in sources.[^1]
- Trading volume: \$199.74M (24h), with DEX \$94.77M; cumulative fees imply billions in agent token trades since launch.[^1]
- Monthly active users: No direct MAU; 1.05M \$VIRTUAL holders as proxy; low recent fees suggest <1K active traders.[^2][^1]


## Fee Structure

Creators receive 40% of SubDAO fees (from agent token trades) directly to wallets, post-2025 update removing thresholds/boosts.  Platform retains ~60% (10% to ACP reserve, rest protocol); fees annualized \$1.93M but 30d \$158K.[^3][^4][^1]

## User Complaints

Reddit users call it "pure trash," citing poor organization, no clear team/partnerships, hype-driven without utility ("far-fetched use-cases," "promise of easy 10x").  Threads question if "VP dead" amid rapid value loss.[^5][^6]

## Token Price Drop

\$VIRTUAL peaked at \$5.07, now \$1.56 (-69%); drops from profit-taking (\$28M cashed post-\$5.26 ATH in Feb 2025) and waning AI agent hype.  User behavior: Early pumps via launches, then dumps as trading fees/revenue plunged (Q3 2025* \$142K vs Q1 \$4.18M).[^7][^2][^1]

## Creator Earnings

Top teams earn \$2K-\$10K/day from trading fees (sustaining builds without VC).  Median lower; with 30d platform revenue \$158K and 40% creator share (~\$63K split across creators), typical median ~\$0-1K/month amid revenue crash.[^8][^1]

## Features Check

No dedicated skill marketplace; focuses on agent tokenization/trading.  No holder-gated content mentioned; co-ownership via tokens but not access-gated.[^1]
