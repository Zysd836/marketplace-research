# I'm building a marketplace where AI agent creators can publish and sell reusable AI skills (prompts, workflows, tool integrations, automation scripts). Buyers can browse, download, and integrate these skills into their own AI agents. There are two access tiers: free/public skills and premium skills that require holding the creator's token to access.

Find me every existing platform — Web3 or Web2 — where developers/creators can publish AI capabilities (skills, plugins, tools, agents, prompts, workflows) and earn revenue when others use them.

For each platform found, I need:

1. Platform name + URL
2. What exactly can be listed/sold (prompts? plugins? full agents? workflows?)
3. How does the creator earn money? (revenue share %, flat fee, subscription cut, token model)
4. How does the buyer pay? (subscription, per-use, one-time purchase, token)
5. The platform's take rate (what % the platform keeps)
6. Number of listings/creators/buyers if publicly available
7. Monthly revenue or GMV if available
8. Main user segment (developers? businesses? consumers?)

Include: GPT store, Claude plugins, open-source registries, Web3 agent marketplaces, LangChain hub, any prompt marketplaces, anything relevant.

Several platforms exist for creators to publish and monetize AI skills like prompts, agents, plugins, and workflows, spanning Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. Here's a breakdown of key ones based on established marketplaces as of early 2026.[^1][^2][^6]

| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| GPT Store | GPTs, prompts | Usage share (70%) | Per-use | 30% | Consumers/devs [^1] |

Other mentions like Claude Artifacts (plugins via API, no full store) and emerging Web3 agent markets (e.g., via token-gated access) fit but lack detailed public monetization data. Open-source registries like Hugging Face Spaces allow model/agent sharing but minimal direct revenue.[^3][^1]
