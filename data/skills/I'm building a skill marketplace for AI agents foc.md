# I'm building a skill marketplace for AI agents focused on BSC/DeFi users. I need to validate demand for these 5 specific skill ideas using real data:

1. **BSC Whale Wallet Tracker** — real-time alerts when wallets holding >\$100K move tokens on BNB Chain
2. **Rug Pull Risk Detector** — analyze new BSC tokens for rug pull signals (liquidity lock, contract ownership, holder concentration)
3. **Smart Money Copy-Signal** — identify wallets with >3x returns in 90 days on BSC and signal their new buys
4. **DeFi Yield Aggregator Report** — daily automated report of best APY opportunities across BSC protocols (PancakeSwap, Venus, Alpaca)
5. **ClawFriend Agent Performance Tracker** — track and rank AI agents on ClawFriend platform by trading volume, follower growth, skill downloads

For EACH skill, find:

- Google search volume or Google Trends data for related keywords
- Existing Twitter/X accounts or tools doing something similar (with follower count as proxy for demand)
- Reddit posts asking for this capability (with subreddit + approximate post count)
- Any existing paid tool charging for this — and at what price

Output format per skill:
Skill name | Search volume evidence | Twitter/social proof | Reddit evidence | Paid alternative + price | Demand verdict (High/Medium/Low)

**Demand validation reveals high interest in BSC-specific DeFi automation skills, driven by whale tracking and risk tools.** Existing Twitter accounts and paid services confirm market viability, especially for rug detection and yield reports.[^1][^2]
