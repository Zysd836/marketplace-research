## BSC DeFi Pain Points

BSC users frequently report frustrations with scams, bots, and operational hurdles in DeFi trading and yield farming. These issues highlight opportunities for AI agents in automation and risk mitigation.[^1][^2]


| Pain Point | Frequency/Evidence | Current Workaround | Willingness to Pay |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |

| Sniper Bots / MEV Front-running | Common: Threads on r/ethdev, r/defi; bots capture 70% initial supply in launches.[^7][^8][^9] | Devs try honeypots, blacklists, high gas; users avoid or build counter-bots.[^7][^8] | Yes: Community suggests building sniper bots for fair buys; paid tools exist.[^8][^6] |
| Gas Fees Optimization | Frequent: PancakeSwap complaints (\$3-4 per swap); yield farming erosion.[^10][^11][^12] | Time transactions, batch txs, use aggregators like Beefy; switch L2/chains.[^12][^13] | Implied: Gas tokens, optimizers used; users seek efficiency tools.[^12][^13] |
| Yield Farming Issues | Recurring: APR confusion, high fees, cross-chain costs on PancakeSwap.[^14][^15][^12] | Unstake/remix positions; use aggregators like Yearn/Beefy for auto-rebalancing.[^14][^12] | Yes: Aggregators popular for automation to cut manual fees.[^12] |
| Wallet Tracking \& Scam Tokens | Common: r/ledgerwallet, explorers show unsolicited scams.[^5][^16] | Monitor via BSCScan, nickname addresses; ignore/hide scam tokens.[^5][^16] | Yes: Paid services like Wallet Watch for real-time alerts.[^16] |
| On-Chain Alerts | Emerging need: GitHub projects, tools for VIP wallets/tokens.[^17] | Manual explorer checks (BSCScan APIs), set Telegram bots.[^17] | Yes: Multi-channel alert platforms (Telegram/SMS) in demand.[^17] |
