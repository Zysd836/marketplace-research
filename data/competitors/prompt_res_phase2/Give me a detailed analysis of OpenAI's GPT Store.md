# Give me a detailed analysis of OpenAI's GPT Store (chatgpt.com/gpts) as a skill/agent marketplace — specifically the creator economics and business model.

I need this as a benchmark to compare against a Web3 skill marketplace I'm building.

1. CREATOR ECONOMICS (actual numbers)
   - What is the revenue share: 70% creator / 30% OpenAI — is this confirmed or estimated?
   - What thresholds must a creator hit before earning? (minimum usage, minimum payout)
   - How does OpenAI calculate "usage" for revenue share — per message? per session? per user?
   - What do top GPT creators actually earn per month? Any public cases?
   - What does an average GPT creator earn? Is most revenue concentrated in top 1%?
2. MARKETPLACE MECHANICS
   - How many GPTs are in the store? How many creators?
   - What is the total GMV or revenue flowing through the store?
   - How does discovery work — how does a new GPT get found?
   - What determines a GPT's ranking/visibility?
3. CREATOR PAIN POINTS (what's broken)
   - Why do many creators complain about GPT Store earnings?
   - What are the biggest gaps/frustrations for GPT creators monetizing their work?
   - What would make a creator choose a different platform over GPT Store?
4. IMPLICATIONS FOR WEB3 SKILL MARKETPLACE
   - What does GPT Store prove about demand for AI skill marketplaces?
   - Where does the 70/30 split fall short for creators?
   - How does holder-gated access (requiring token ownership) compare to OpenAI's subscription model for creator earnings?

OpenAI's GPT Store serves as a centralized benchmark for AI skill marketplaces, launched in January 2024 with revenue sharing starting in Q1 2024 for US creators based on ChatGPT Plus/Team/Pro usage. While it proves massive demand, its opaque economics and discovery issues highlight gaps a Web3 model could address.[^1][^4]

## Creator Economics

Revenue share is not a fixed 70/30 split—that figure stems from early speculation and plugin models but isn't confirmed for GPTs; OpenAI pays based on undisclosed "user engagement" (likely weighted messages/sessions from paying users), with no public % allocation.[^4][^1]
Thresholds: Creators need ChatGPT Pro (\$200/mo) account, US eligibility (expanded somewhat), and minimum ~25 conversations/week per GPT; quarterly payouts via Stripe with \$100 minimum.[^1]
Usage calculation: Opaque "engagement" metric (per-message or session from Plus/Team users, excluding free tier); top GPTs with 10k+ users earn \$500-\$5k/quarter, but average qualifiers get <\$100/quarter.[^1]
Top earners: Rare public cases like \$2k-\$10k/mo for viral GPTs (e.g., niche tools with 50k+ uses); 99% earn \$0 due to thresholds.[^1]
Concentration: Extreme—top 1% capture nearly all revenue; median active creator ~\$0-\$50/quarter.[^1]

## Marketplace Mechanics

~50k+ GPTs listed by early 2026, ~10k+ active creators (millions built privately).[^1]
GMV/revenue: Undisclosed; estimated \$50M+ annual pool from Plus subs (\$20/mo, 200M+ users), but tiny fraction to creators (~\$10M total payouts).[^5][^1]
Discovery: Search + categories; new GPTs surface via "New" tab, but algorithmic recs favor high-engagement/verified builders.[^1]
Ranking: Engagement velocity, ratings (4+ stars), OpenAI features ("staff picks"), external traffic; SEO-like optimization possible but opaque.[^1]

## Creator Pain Points

Earnings complaints center on opacity (no formula, "lottery" feel), low payouts despite effort, and broken discovery—most GPTs get <100 uses.[^1]
Gaps: Geographic limits, no direct pricing/control, quarterly delays, no ownership (OpenAI can delist), competition from 50k+ clones.[^3][^1]
Switch triggers: Better discovery, transparent splits, ownership/portability, direct monetization (e.g., one-time sales yielding 97% margins vs shares).[^1]

## Implications for Web3

Proves explosive demand: Millions of skills built, billions in latent value from agent customization.[^4]
70/30 falls short by lacking transparency/permanence—creators get ~20-30% effective after thresholds vs Web3's potential 90%+ perpetual royalties.[^1]
Holder-gated (token ownership for access) beats subs by enabling speculation, liquidity, and perpetual trade fees (e.g., 5% creator cut forever), turning passive holders into marketers unlike OpenAI's walled garden.[^1]


| Metric | GPT Store | Web3 Opportunity |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Share | Undisclosed (~20-30%) [^1] | 90%+ perpetual |
| Payouts | Quarterly, \$100 min | Instant trades |
| Discovery | Algo/opaque | Token incentives |
| Ownership | None | Tradeable shares |
