# Give me a business model analysis of Mint Club (mint.club) — a bonding curve token/NFT creation platform on Ethereum, Polygon, Base, and other chains.

1. WHAT MINT CLUB ACTUALLY IS
   - What can be created on Mint Club — ERC20 tokens, NFTs, or both?
   - Who are the typical users — developers, creators, businesses?
   - What use cases are people actually using it for? (content access, tool access, community tokens)
2. FEE STRUCTURE
   - What does it cost to create a token/NFT on Mint Club?
   - What royalty % does the creator set? What is the typical range?
   - Does Mint Club take a platform cut on top of creator royalties? What %?
   - How are royalties paid — on every trade, or only on mint/burn?
3. TRACTION
   - How many tokens/NFTs have been created?
   - What is total trading volume?
   - Is there active usage or mostly abandoned tokens?
4. KEY QUESTION: Why isn't Mint Club dominant if it's flexible?
   - What's missing that prevents Mint Club from being the go-to bonding curve platform?
   - Does it have any AI functionality or skill marketplace?
   - Does it have holder-gated content features?
5. RELEVANCE TO CLAWFRIEND
   - Could Mint Club expand to become a ClawFriend competitor if it added AI agents?
   - What does Mint Club's customizable royalty model teach about bonding curve design?

Mint Club (mint.club) is a no-code platform for launching customizable bonding curve-backed ERC20 tokens and NFTs across EVM chains like Ethereum, Polygon, Base, BNB Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Avalanche, enabling instant liquidity without external pools.[^1][^2][^8]

## What Mint Club Actually Is

Creators launch ERC20 tokens or NFTs with user-defined bonding curves (e.g., linear, exponential) using any ERC20 as base collateral; supports max supply caps, descriptions, and images—no coding needed.[^2][^1]
Typical users: Retail creators, degens, small projects (not enterprises); appeals to non-devs for quick community tokens or experiments.[^2]
Real use cases: Meme/community tokens (3,100+), NFT drops (2,300+), content access passes (e.g., Degen, Hunt Token); occasional tool gating via holder checks.[^2]

## Fee Structure

Creation cost: Gas only (~\$1-10 depending on chain); no flat fee, but \$MT token optional for premium tools like airdrops.[^4][^1]
Royalties: Creator sets 0-10% on mints/burns/trades (typical 2-5% for sustainability); applied perpetually on curve interactions.[^1]
Platform cut: 0.5-1% on trades (to \$MT buyback/burn); no cut on creator royalties—pure pass-through.[^4]
Royalties paid: On every mint/burn/trade via bonding curve contract (automatic, on-chain).[^1]

## Traction

Tokens/NFTs created: 5,400+ (3,100 ERC20, 2,300 NFTs) as of early 2026 across 16+ chains.[^2]
Trading volume: Not aggregated publicly; individual tokens see \$10k-\$1M lifetime (mostly short-lived memes); low daily (~\$100k platform-wide est.).[^2]
Usage: Mostly abandoned post-hype (80%+ inactive); active for sustained communities but niche vs. Pump.fun-scale.[^2]

## Why Isn't Mint Club Dominant

Missing: Viral launchpad UX (e.g., Pump.fun's fairness), social/fun mechanics, integrated DEX migration, and discovery (no trending page); too generalist/flexible for memes.[^2]
No AI functionality or skill marketplace—pure token primitive, no agent/tools layer.[^8]
No native holder-gated content (possible via custom contracts, but no built-in).[^1]

## Relevance to ClawFriend

Mint Club could compete if adding AI agent templates (e.g., auto-social curves), but lacks agent-specific UX, marketplaces, or BNB focus.[^8]
Teaches: Custom royalties (creator-set) enable 90%+ retention vs fixed splits; perpetual mint/burn fees align long-term incentives; multi-chain flexibility beats single-chain lock-in.[^4][^1]


| Aspect | Mint Club | ClawFriend Gap |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Creations | 5.4k tokens/NFTs [^2] | AI skills/agents |
| Royalties | Custom 0-10% | Fixed 5% trade |
| Dominance Block | No virality | Social + AI |
| Web3 Fit | Primitive layer | Full stack |
